Communication:
Use NRF24L01 Transceiver for Communication Between Controller and Car

Actuators:
	2 - Microservo motors for wheel movements on car
	1 - Microservo motors for panoramic
	1- Ultrasonic sensor for data collection 
	Transceiver set for communication
 
Sensors:
	Accelerometer for directional movements 
	Button for state switching 	
  	Ultrasonic sensor for distance sensting

Schematics
	Robot Chassis
	Two Wheels
	Pan Tilt Kit 
	Ultrasonic Sensor 


Process: 
  Button switches control state
  Controller tilt controls movement
  LED tells mode
  Robot recives data and moves
  Ultrasonic sensor runs
  Robot sends ultrasonic senor data to controller
  Controller recives data
  Controller sends data through serial port
  Processing program recieves data and changes background color
