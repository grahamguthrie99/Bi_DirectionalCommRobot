# Bi-Directional Communicating Robot 
Robot receives function from a controller with an accelerometer and robot's ultrasonic sensor communicates back to controller via a NRF24L01 transceiver. Accelerometer controlled robot. Robot performs several functions based on direction of accelerometer. Project includes a small Processing program to demonstrate future functioanlity.
