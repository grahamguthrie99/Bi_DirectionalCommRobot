# Bi-Directional Communicating Robot 
Robot receives function from a controller with an accelerometer and robot's ultrasonic sensor communicates back to controller via a NRF24L01 transceiver. Accelerometer controlled robot. Robot performs several functions based on direction of accelerometer. Project includes a small Processing program to demonstrate future functioanlity.   


Process: 
  Button switches control state
  Controller tilt controls movement
  LED tells mode
  Robot recives data and moves
  Ultrasonic sensor runs
  Robot sends ultrasonic senor data to controller
  Controller recives data
  Controller sends data through serial port
  Processing program recieves data and changes background color
